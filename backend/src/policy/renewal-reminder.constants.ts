/**
 * Renewal reminder configuration constants.
 *
 * LEAD TIME WINDOWS
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Two reminder windows are fired per policy, in decreasing urgency order:
 *
 *   REMINDER_7D  — sent when endLedger - currentLedger <= 120,960 ledgers
 *                  (≈ 7 days at 5 s/ledger: 7 × 86,400 / 5 = 120,960)
 *                  Matches RENEWAL_OPEN_LEDGERS_BEFORE_EXPIRY — the earliest
 *                  point the policy holder can act on a renewal.
 *
 *   REMINDER_1D  — sent when endLedger - currentLedger <= 17,280 ledgers
 *                  (≈ 1 day at 5 s/ledger: 86,400 / 5 = 17,280)
 *                  Final nudge; window still open but urgency is high.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENCY KEY
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * BullMQ job IDs are set to `renewal-reminder:{policyId}:{reminderType}`.
 * BullMQ rejects duplicate job IDs when the previous job is still in the
 * waiting / active / delayed set, which prevents the scanner from enqueuing
 * the same reminder twice. Jobs that complete or fail are removed per
 * removeOnComplete / removeOnFail settings so the same reminder CAN be
 * re-enqueued in the next scan cycle if the earlier attempt failed.
 *
 * TIME BUDGET (staging dataset: up to 50,000 active policies)
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The scanner paginates in batches of SCAN_PAGE_SIZE (default 500).
 * Each page issues one Prisma query (indexed on endLedger + isActive + deletedAt).
 * At 50,000 policies with a 60-day expiry window, the scanner processes at most
 * ~8,333 policies per run (assuming uniform expiry distribution).
 * Estimated wall-clock time: < 5 seconds per scan on a 2-vCPU staging instance.
 * The @Cron schedule runs hourly; the isRunning guard prevents overlap.
